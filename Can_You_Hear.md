### Can You Hear

Can you hear me
Whispering your name?
Do you feel me
Lying beside you?
Even though we’re apart
Can you hear my beating heart?
It’s sending a message to you

Can you hear me
Calling out your name?
In that moment
Hoping we will treasure
How she drifted us apart
That space in my heart
Will always be a heaven for you

Please don’t go
Please don’t go
When we lie together
Hearts keep time forever
Oh Please don’t go
Please don’t go away
Please tell I’d like to know can you hear me?

Can you hear me
Whispering your name?
Do you feel me
Lying beside you?
Even though we’re apart
Can you hear my beating heart?
It’s sending a message to you

Can you hear me
Crying out your name?
In that moment
Reflect in each other
Shall we pick up the parts?
That space in my heart
Can only hold a picture of you

Please don’t go
Please don’t go
When we lie together
Hearts keep time forever
Oh Please don’t go
Please don’t go away
Please tell I’d like to know can you hear me?

Wrapped in your arms
Safe from love’s harm
When we lie together
Hearts could cry forever
I need you tonight
In darkness I fight
Please tell I’d like to know can you hear me?
