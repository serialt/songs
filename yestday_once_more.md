### Yesterday Once More

```
When I was young
I'd listen to the radio
Waitin' for my favorite songs when they played I'd sing along
It made me smile
Those were such happy times
And not so long ago
How I wondered where they'd gone
But they're back again
Just like a long lost friend
All the songs I loved so well
Every sha la la la
Every wo o wo o
Still shines
Every shing a ling a ling
That they're startin' to sing's
So fine
When they get to the part
Where he's breakin' her heart
It can really make me cry
Just like before
It's yesterday once more
Lookin' back on how it was
In years gone by
And the good times that I had
Makes today seem rather sad
So much has changed
It was songs of love that
I would sing to then
And I'd memorize each word
Those old melodies
Still sound so good to me
As they melt the years away
Every sha la la la
Every wo o wo o
Still shines
Every shing a ling a ling
That they're startin' to sing's
So fine
All my best memories
Come back clearly to me
Some can even make me cry
Just like before
It's yesterday once more
Every sha la la la
Every wo o wo o
Still shines
Every shing a ling a ling
That they're startin' to sing's
So fine
Every sha la la la
Every wo o wo o
Still shines
Every shing a ling a ling
That they're startin' to sing's
So fine
